# Computer-Vision

## Describe
- This repository includes all individual homeworks, labs and group project of Computer Vision course at Ho Chi Minh University of Science

## Homework
- The purpose of these homeworks is to familiarize with simple neural network models, such as: MLP, CNN Lenet-5.
- The dataset is used in these homework is MNIST Digit and MNIST Fashion 

## Lab
- There are 3 labs written in C++ to implement basic algorithm in computer vision
    + Lab01: Image Transformation
    + Lab02: Harris Detection
    + Lab03: Object Detection
## Project
- The program is used to detect and recognize logos from an image or video input, which can assist in the process of checking the copyrightability of logos of brands.
- The Logo dataset was collected from various sources to diversify the information that the system can recognize, containing over 4,000 images of 53 different brands such as Adidas, Chanel, Uniqlo, etc.
- The YOLOv5 model is fine-tuned and trained on the prepared logo dataset with the goal of detecting and recognizing the logos present in the images or videos
